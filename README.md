# jambot
Jambot was my capstone design project at university, built along with 3 other group members.
It receives multiple audio input channels and drives stage lights in a light-show using that input, in real-time, as well
as synchronizes song lyrics with song sections, even if not played in order. It is built as a Visual Studio project in C++,
and uses fuzzy logic, fast Fourier transform, Tabu Search optimization algorithm, multi-threading, and GTK+.

The bulk of the interesting source code files can be found under /Jambot.
