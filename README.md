# jambot
Jambot was my capstone design project at university, built along with 3 other group members.
It receives multiple audio input channels and drives stage lights in a light-show using that input, in real-time, as well
as synchronizes song lyrics with song sections, even if not played in order. Uses fuzzy logic, fast Fourier transform,
Tabu Search optimization algorithm, multi-threading, GTK+.

All files of interest can be found in the Jambot/ folder.
